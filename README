Use an intelligent prompt for zsh or bash with status line support.

This is a collection of scripts which allow you to display a prompt
for zsh or bash and also setting a corresponding hardstatus line
(if your terminal supports it).

To install these scripts, copy them somewhere into your $PATH;
set_prompt.config can alternatively also be copied into /etc.
For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).

The main program is
	set_prompt
To get help for this program, call
	set_prompt -h

The set_prompt program outputs a valid string for PS1 for zsh
(or for bash if the -b option is used).
It can be executed or also be sourced by zsh or by bash (which is faster).
Note that even if sourced from bash, the -b option is not implied.

By default, the set_prompt program sources the configuration file
	set_prompt.config
So you should customize that file for your taste (e.g. to define the colors).

There is a sample script
	set_prompt.sh
which, if sourced, defines and executes a function
	set_prompt
which acts like the set_prompt program with the difference that is sends the
output directly to PS1 and that appropriate options are used by default.
The set_prompt.sh script makes use of particular variables, so you might
want to look at the source and modify it for your needs before using it.

Finally, the prompt supports also the variables VCSBRANCH and VCSSTATUS
which might be changed for each prompt. For zsh, there is also a script
	git_prompt.zsh
which, if sourced, sets VCSBRANCH and VCSSTATUS correspondingly if you change
into a git directory.
